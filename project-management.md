# Group collaboration

#### Project Management

* What are we doing
* who is doing what
* When is what we are doing supposed to be finished
* Why is what we are doing relevant to users

#### Apply small team projects agile processes are best:

1. Break user stories into small tasks
2. Design, implement, test, deliver during a **sprint**

**Process:**

* open
* In development
* Ready for evaluation
* Completed

Catch up important information instead of huge document at the end.

**Tips:**

* Weekly status and planning meetings \(customer should come\)
*   - walk through each user story
*   - Discuss last week progress, difficulties, plans for the next week
*   - Check off completed tasks
*   - Capture conclusions  

#### Source Code Management

* version control \(look at the change to find the new bug\)
* multiple source code repositories
* branching 
* code merge between branches

Building test and 

* reproducible builds, same library and confiture \(operating system, libraries, drivers\).
* continuous integration \(CI\) and continuous deployment \(CD\)
* commonly used today: containers \(is a way to isolate thing, isolate operating system, or isolate environment. eg, Docker\), script to deploy environment automatically 
* automated tests, unit tests, integration tests \(auto\), system tests \(auto\)
