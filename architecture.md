# Architecture and design

#### Design

plan/solution to how to satisfy requirements

#### Leverl of design

1. high level design\(aka architectural design\): main system components and their connections
2. detailed design - details such as algorithm selection , detail API design ……\(allow to write code\)

#### subject of design

1. sofware design - architecture + detailed design as it relates to code
2. end - user interface design - usability + esthetics 

#### Architecture:

1. components + connections: Join happends, think about how components communicate with each other.
2. often represented using nultiple views: It's good that different people work on different specifications
3. now responsibilities assigned to developers

#### Design process

1. Design criterion: function requirements and quality requirements. 
2. Design loop: generalize ideas, analysize design criterion, make decision, optimization.

#### Avarage exercise

1. store running sum of numbsers+count, return total divided by count
2. Take average of pairs of numbers then recursively averages of result pairs
3. Divide each number by the count and add 
4. split into subsets, solve subproblems , aggregate 
5. store entire input then caculate on demand

#### Design loop

1. systemsis \(generate ideas\), brain stroming, iterative reaserch, experience
2. conceptualize design ideas,descrption, prototyle, simulation
3. analyze, evaluate what requirements and design criteria
4. decision making, trade off resolved.

#### Design contian:

Fitteness for purpose: functionality, runime perfermance, reliability, security, ……

fiterness for futhure: Modifiability, extensibility, maintainability，……

#### Maintenance:

repairs -&gt; removing reperted faults \(corrective maintenance\) + discovery and removal of dormant fualts\(preventative maintenance\)

modifications -&gt; new features\(extension\) + adjusted to environment changes\(adaptive maintenance\)

#### Modifiability:

functional modify quality 

module is a unit of system decomposition with how well define purpose and interface

interface is a contract between the module and the environment
